# Clortho: A CLI password manager

## What is this?

**Clortho** is a password manager written in Ada that I wrote to submit it to the Ada/SPARK crate competition.  It is CLI driven, but it integrates nicely with _cut'n'paste_ buffers (currently working on Linux/X11 only). 

## Why this name?
It is a reference to the [_Keymaster_ of _Ghostbuster_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ghostbusters_characters#The_Terror_Dogs:_Zuul_The_Gatekeeper_and_Vinz_Clortho_The_Keymaster).  Yes, quite an obscure reference, I agree (especially if you weren't a teenager in the  80s).
